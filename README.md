# EngageTrack
Students attend events but don’t always engage meaningfully, and organizers don’t know who’s actually learning or interacting. Build: A system that tracks session attendance, participation in polls/Q&A, and resource downloads. Using a scoring model, it builds a dynamic "engagement score" per user, visualized in a dashboard — ideal for hackathons or conferences.
